GitHub Africa
=============

Project to help highlight GitHub usage in Africa

Methodology
-----------

Using GitHub API's we searched for all GitHub user's who had an African country or city listed in their profile.  This is obviously an imperfect method but does help illustrate where GitHub usage in Africa is occuring.  We feel this provides a good proxy where opensource and modern software practices is growing in Africa. 

These scripts in this repo where used to generate the [github-africa-users](https://github.com/codeafrica/github-africa/blob/master/data/github-africa-users-20141231.csv) list.  We used this data to create the GitHub Africa User's Map at: [codeafrica.org](http://codeafrica.org)
