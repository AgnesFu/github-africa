GitHub Africa
=============

Project to help extra and highlight GitHub users in Africa

Methodology
-----------

Using GitHub API's we searched for all user's who had an African country or city listed in their profile.  This is obviously an imperfect method but does help illustrate where GitHub usage in Africa.  We feel this provides a good proxy where opensource and modern software practices is growing in Africa. 

These scripts in this repo where used to generate the [github-africa-users](https://github.com/codeafrica/github-africa/blob/master/data/github-africa-users-20141231.csv) list.  We used this data to create the GitHub Africa User's Map at: http://codeafrica.org
